"""Email Triage Environment — Core simulation logic.

Implements reset(), step(), and state for the OpenEnv 3-method interface.
Generates synthetic but realistic emails and grades agent triage actions.

Features:
- 30+ synthetic emails across 5 categories (spam, newsletter, personal, work, urgent)
- Email threads with conversation context (agent must reason about full threads)
- SLA/deadline tracking with urgency decay (novel mechanic)
- Multi-dimensional grading: category, priority, response quality, SLA awareness
- 3 tasks: Easy (categorize), Medium (categorize + prioritize), Hard (full triage + threads + SLA)
